MailFleet - Rapid Modular Email

Lets be honest here HTML emails are the worst, worse than your first kiss, and that time your friend told you he/she ran a half marathon
(Great! you half accomplished half of something, stickers for you! -_-).<br>

Anyway! I've built something that makes them feel less like you were invited to The Red Wedding and more like you just got done eating Thanksgiving dinner with your slightly racist grandmother.

###How Does It Work
Using handlebar expressions you can include modules you want to stack in the Orbiter.html file in the Station folder. On save, the metalsmith compiler will grab those module files and compile all the modules you want into the dist folder. Once you get all the modules you like, you can take the compiled file, insert your content, make any changes, and presto I've just saved you from a self inflicted head injury. Run 'npm start' to start the metalsmith compiler and browser-sync.

###What Do I Get
I have for you
- 50 Premade HTML Email Modules included from the kind [Matt Harris](http://outlinemail.co.uk/)
- Gabe Newell giving you a straight answer to a question.
- Profit.


This Project is not complete so please chill.

###Things I Need to Do
- Add placeholders for dummy content
- Add more modules
- Create a Second micro module process compiler
- Learn what a "Nae Nae" is.

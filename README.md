# MailFleet: Rapid Modular Email
HTML emails are a headache to write, but they can be a little easier with this prebuilt workflow. Quickly build emails by
stacking modules you want, then have it all compiled for you. Mailfleet gives you a massive headstart in creating your custom html templates by
having a ready made library of common html patterns. The 50 premade html patterns are also tested and compatiable with 30+ email clients. 

## How Does It Work
Using handlebar expressions you can include modules you want to stack in the hub/index.hbs file. On save, 
the metalsmith compiler will grab those module files and compile them into the dist folder to create index.html. 
Once you get all the modules you like, you can take the compiled file, insert your content, make any changes, and presto I've 
just saved you from a self inflicted head injury. Run 'npm start' to begin the dev enironment which includes browser-sync.

# MailFleet: Rapid Modular Email

Lets be honest here HTML emails are the worst, worse than your first kiss, and
that time your friend told you they ran a half marathon (Great! you half
accomplished half of something, stickers for you! -_-).

Anyway! I've built something that makes them feel less like you were invited to
The Red Wedding and more like you just got done eating Thanksgiving dinner with
your slightly racist grandmother.

## How Does It Work
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`
1. relax.

## What Do I Get
I have for you
- Tons of rock solid email patterns from [Outline Mail](http://outlinemail.co.uk)
- Gabe Newell giving you a straight answer to a question.
- Profit.

This Project is not complete so please chill.

## Things I Need to Do
- Add placeholders for dummy content
- Add more modules
- Learn what a "Nae Nae" is.

# Contributing to MailFleet

## Reporting Bugs
One of the easiest and most useful things you can do is submit bug reports to
Gitlab. Please reduce the case as much as you possibly can.

## Bugfixes
MailFleet actively encourages any bugfixes that are verified. Please fork the
repo and submit a pull request and your fix will be integrated at the nearest
convenient time.

## New Mail Modules
New mail modules are the best thing you can possibly send. They should be tested
if possible but will definitely be tested against supported clients before
integration into MailFleet. If the tests fail, you will be informed of which
tests were failing so you can fix these problems.

## Improvements
Improvements in speed, performance, or functionality that do not deviate from
the current operational or UX paradigms will generally be accepted. As long as
you aren't changing functionality, these sorts of pull requests are mostly
welcomed, but if you're doing something highly opinionated, you might want to
open an issue or ping a maintainer about it first.

## Changes Breaking or Otherwise
Changes are often welcomed but you should check with the maintainers before
working on these because it might be contrary to already-established app
functionality or philosophy. We're open to change but certain decisions have
been made for a reason so we would hate to see you put a bunch of effort into
improvements only to find out they cannot be accepted.

Thanks for your interest in contributing!
